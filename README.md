# Qt-py Dashboard for Challenger 2023

Designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi

Some info re: integration w/ hardware and theory of operation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cGimtCK8eluC2UDLXcvhuKnaBOUmhU2zC9_unpOaDNo/edit?usp=sharing 

Main execution file is `run.py` and relies on `system.py` for hardware integration. The rest is Qt-related stuff and code for the arduino interface, also a Makefile for easier repo management.
